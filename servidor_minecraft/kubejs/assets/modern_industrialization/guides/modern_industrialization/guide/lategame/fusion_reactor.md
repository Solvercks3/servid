## Fusion Reactor

<Recipe id="modern_industrialization:electric_age/machine/fusion_reactor_asbl" />

The Fusion Reactor is the ultimate energy source! It can combine Deuterium, Tritium, and/or Helium-3 into Helium Plasma, the most powerful fuel in the game!. However, it requires a large amount of energy to ignite the reaction.

## Plasma Turbine

<Recipe id="modern_industrialization:electric_age/machine/plasma_turbine_asbl" />

The Plasma Turbine can turn Helium Plasma into EU, at the rate of 100 kEU per millibucket. Its maximum production rate is roughly 1 MEU/t.

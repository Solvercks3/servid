# Quantum Tier

## Singularity

<ItemGrid>
  <ItemIcon id="modern_industrialization:singularity" />
</ItemGrid>

What happens when scientists try to build a miniature black hole in their lab?

The Singularity is the answer: this immensely powerful ball of matter has very useful quantum physics applications with the proper stabilizing materials.

## Quantum Upgrade

<ItemGrid>
  <ItemIcon id="modern_industrialization:quantum_upgrade" />
</ItemGrid>

The Quantum Upgrade is the most powerful machine upgrade ever. Have a look for yourself.

## Quantum Sword

<ItemGrid>
  <ItemIcon id="modern_industrialization:quantum_sword" />
</ItemGrid>

The Quantum Sword uses the raw power of the Schr√∂dinger equation to instantly vaporize any foe (or friend!) you hit with it.

## Quantum Armor

  <ItemIcon id="modern_industrialization:quantum_boots" />
</ItemGrid>

Through the gravitational effect of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the full Quantum Armor set makes you immune to all damage and grants you creative flight. Each new piece of armour increases by 25% the likelihood of nullifying any damage taken.

## Quantum Barrel

The Quantum Barrel is the ultimate barrel tier: it can hold 2,147,483,647 stacks of a single item!

## Quantum Tank

<ItemGrid>
  <ItemIcon id="modern_industrialization:quantum_tank" />
</ItemGrid>

The Quantum Tank is the most powerful tank tier: it can hold 2,147,483,647 buckets of a single fluid!

## UU Matter

<ItemGrid>
  <ItemIcon id="modern_industrialization:uu_matter_bucket" />
</ItemGrid>

With a suitable Electrolyzer setup and a Singularity, large amounts of energy can be turned through Quantum Hawnking Radiation, into Universally Useable Matter also known as UU Matter, the very fabric of the universe.

## Replicator

<ItemGrid>
  <ItemIcon id="modern_industrialization:replicator" />
</ItemGrid>

With 1 mB of UU Matter, the replicator can duplicate (almost) any item in the game!

Congratulations, it is now Yourcraft. Thanks for playing Modern Industrialization.

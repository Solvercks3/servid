# Getting Started

Before making bronze, we will need to create a Forge Hammer. It is used for basic processing steps.

You can put iron, copper and tin ore in the forge hammer and you will receive 2 raw ores per ore. You can increase this ratio by using a Hammer. Every raw ores can be smelted into an ingot.

The Hammer increases the ratio in the Forge Hammer and unlocks more recipes, at the cost of some durability

Now, you may want to consider making a Steam Mining Drill to obtain the ores directly without needing a Silk Touch pickaxe.

## Steam Mining Drill

The Steam Mining Drill can mine 3x3 blocks at the time, perfect for your early game mining needs! It also has Silk Touch which combines well with the Forge Hammer.

The Steam Mining Drill requires both water and solid fuel (for example coal).

Right-click a water source to fill it with water, and make sure to always place some fuel in your drill by right-clicking the fuel items on it in your inventory. The fuel will be consumed slowly when you mine.

# Your First Steel

You can macerate coke to obtain Coke Dust, which you can combine with iron to get Uncooked Steel Dust. Using the mixer will give you a better ratio, of course. Now, you will need a Steam Blast Furnace to turn that into steel.

Craft the controller, 29 Fire Clay Bricks and the same three hatches as the Coke Oven.

## The Blast Furnace

The Blast Furnace's structure is the same as the Coke Oven's, with Bricks replaced by Fire Clay Bricks and one extra hollow layer on top.

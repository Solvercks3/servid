# Tanks & Barrels

Bronze tanks can store 4 buckets of fluid each, you can use them to interact with machines, and you can place them in the world.

Bronze barrels can be used to store and move 32 stacks of one item.

When placed in the world, you can right-click them with buckets or other tanks to transfer fluids.

Also, you can stack them in your inventory if they have the same contents. How nifty!

## Bronze Barrel

<Recipe id="modern_industrialization:materials/bronze/craft/barrel"/>

Left-click to give a stack to a placed barrel (shift to give as much as possible).

Right-click to take a stack from a placed barrel (shift to take only 1 item).

If you break a barrel it will keep its stored contents, and you will get an item that you can interact with.

Left-click on a barrel item with an item to insert it into the barrel.

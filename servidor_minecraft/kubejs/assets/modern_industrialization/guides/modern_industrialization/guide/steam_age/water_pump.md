# Infinite Water?

You may have been wondering if perhaps there was a way to insert water into the boiler automatically? There is!

That's exactly what the water pump does. Surround it horizontally with water blocks, and it will start producing water for 1 EU/t.

It will automatically transfer water to the machine on its output side.

The Bronze Water Pump will produce 1/8th of a bucket of water for every adjacent water source every 5 seconds, for a max output of 1 bucket / 5 seconds.
